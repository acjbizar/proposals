Resource is found, but represents a automated response that is probably not very useful to regular visitors.

This status could be used by domain registrars and brokers for hostnames that they manage, but are for sale, or being held for a client.

Back-ends could use this status code to distinguish hostnames that are actually being used, and those that are just online.
