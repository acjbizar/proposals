# ``@ambilight``

## Properties

<dl>
<dt>`background`</dt>
<dd>Because <dfn>ambilight</dfn> (ambient light) outputs are generally deduced from whatever is shown on the screen, a background -- which can define the visual contents of the entire canvas -- seems like an appropriate property.</dd>
</dl>

## Examples

```css
@ambilight {
  background: red;
}
```
